Note: A display problem was caused as I changed the given direction arrow defines in player.h to "^", ">", "v", "<".
I could not find a solution to it but the display should have no problem when the arrows are the default given:
#define DIRECTION_ARROW_OUTPUT_NORTH "\xe2\x86\x91"
#define DIRECTION_ARROW_OUTPUT_EAST "\xe2\x86\x92"
#define DIRECTION_ARROW_OUTPUT_SOUTH "\xe2\x86\x93"
#define DIRECTION_ARROW_OUTPUT_WEST "\xe2\x86\x90"
